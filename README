ABOUT
-----

nyx is an alternative game engine focused on retro style and pixel art games.

This repository is just a dump of what is currently heavy work in progress.

Everything is broken, undocumented, untested, and unoptimised. Do not use in
production or anywhere else. Do not complain.

INSTALLATION
------------

If you still want to play with it, you need to know how to build and install a
library for your operating system. There are build scripts for your
convenience. For optimal performance you may want to build the library (for
example using the build.sh script) with the following optimisation flags:

-O3 -DNDEBUG -march=native -fomit-frame-pointer
